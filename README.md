## Description

The Perseo Feedback System is an open-source plugin for WordPress websites. It adds a feedback prompt to your pages, asking users a question of your choice with two simple buttons. After users have clicked the button, a textarea is shown to collect a comment which is saved in the database once the send button is clicked.
You can set the options within the "Perseo Feedback" settings menu that appears after plugin activation.

The feedback prompt appears 5 seconds after the page has loaded, providing a non-intrusive way of gathering user feedback.
